				<p><em>Dear Kerry,</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>My son went to a birthday party for his 6-year-old classmate. It was at a bowling alley and the parents set it up as a competition. I couldn’t see the point of this for this age group, although my son didn’t complain. He thought the cake and ice cream were really good! How can I decide what’s age-appropriate for celebrations?</em></p>
<p><em>CP, Ontario</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Dear CP,</p>
<p>There are many ways that children today are expected or influenced to act older than their age. When it’s little girls wearing makeup and high heels at seven or eight, it’s easy to see that they are being introduced to sexuality too early. With wholesome activities it’s harder to draw clear lines, since we can all potentially enjoy bowling or jumping on trampolines.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the activities themselves, let’s start by thinking about why we have birthday parties at all. Not all cultures focus on children’s birthdays or celebrate them the way we do in the United States. I have a hunch that the impulse springs from how we feel about our children’s birthdays – it was certainly a life-changing event to have this child! Perhaps grownups want to convey to children that there is something special about the day they were born. Birthday parties have become one of the ways we show our children how much we love them.</p>
<p>Loving our children isn’t completely simple, though, since there are also times we feel irritated, tired, worried or disappointed with them. Most parents know intellectually that mixed feelings are inevitable, but still often feel guilty for those negative feelings. We might even be inclined to bend over backwards to compensate, perhaps by arranging an over-elaborate or splashy party.</p>
<p>The town or neighborhood you live in may also be a factor – a group of parents may get into an escalating spiral of competition with bigger and better parties. It’s almost like trying to prove who loves their kids the best!</p>
<p>Children know they are loved when they feel secure in their parents’ attention and presence. Others see the reflection of that confidence in the kind of person the child is with himself and his friends, in the way he gives and receives love. A fancy party won’t make up for absence or distraction. So we find ourselves going back to basics if we want to make celebrations that truly express feelings in an accessible way. Parents can express their love by their creative ingenuity and pleasure in the occasion.</p>
<p>What’s fun for kids of different ages? Little kids at preschool age are easily overstimulated or overwhelmed by too much noise, too much unfamiliarity, or demands that are too new. They need parties that don’t last too long, aren’t too big, and that involve activities they are used to, like planting seeds in pots to take home or building snowmen. A good rule of thumb for the size of little children’s parties is to plan for the child’s age plus one – a 3-year-old can truly enjoy having four children over to celebrate.</p>
<p>The possibilities expand with schoolchildren, who have more physical and social skills and have had more group experience at school. Rather than make games into competitions, however, which can lead to disappointment or hurt feelings, parents can devise activities that involve the whole party. A treasure or scavenger hunt, a swimming party, costumes or a theme for games – these enlist the children’s creativity and imagination and provide a framework for self-generated fun.</p>
<p>Middle-schoolers, who may look and act sophisticated beyond their years, are often grateful for a party that does not revolve around social status or competition. The simplest way to provide that is to have parties for just girls or just boys. Having them make their own food, like individual pie-pan pizzas or a big salad bar with lots of ingredients, gives them a chance to do something fun to celebrate together. This is the age group when a bowling alley, skating rink, ropes park, miniature golf and so forth can also be really enjoyable.</p>
<p>Every day can be a celebration of life and love; when it’s the special day of your child’s birthday, your happiness and the gift of your enthusiasm and creativity can underline for your child how glad you are that he was born.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>We all know about the many research studies that have firmly established a link between television violence and children’s aggressive behavior. But parents of preschoolers are unlikely to allow their little children to be watching police shows, violent cartoons, the nightly news, thrillers or reality emergency shows. Don&#8217;t be fooled that they don&#8217;t seem to be paying attention &#8211; children as young as 11 months pick up the emotional tone of television programs and it affects their moods and behavior.</p>
<p>Things get more confusing when we focus on products explicitly targeted for the under-five market. Parents often ask what videos, movies or computer games are right for their children to see.</p>
<p>At preschool, we generally hear parents talk about showing their children videos for three reasons: first, they want the children to learn from them; second, they need something to occupy the children while they do necessary tasks; and third, just as grownups enjoy a good movie or an evening of TV, there can be pleasure or fun for children from movies or games.</p>
<p>Starting with the very youngest – there is nothing more fascinating or instructive for babies than the face of a responsive grownup. No mechanical stimulation can hope to get anywhere near the variety, detail and customizing of interaction that takes place when parents and infants play peekaboo, make faces, sing songs, do fingerplays, read books, or go for a walk together. Hearing music, having conversations, feeling the wind blow, moving rhythmically, and so forth, all stimulate brain development and lay a foundation of pleasure and learning within babies’ most important relationships.</p>
<p>As babies become toddlers and then preschoolers, all their developmental energy is harnessed to the enormous task of mastering the inner realities of feelings and impulses and the outer realities of the world of people and things. Never again will children make such rapid developmental strides in such a short time – there are literally millions of things for them to learn about. They drink in everything around them and reach out to explore and discover more. Figuring out what is real and what is not, working out what causes what, struggling to differentiate what they are in charge of and what they cannot control are all big jobs. Little children can often accurately label things as real or pretend, but they do not securely know the actual difference between real and pretend until they are seven or eight years old, and, even then, occasionally need reassurance from grownups.</p>
<p>In the context of these long developmental efforts, we can see that movies and videos that present fantasy worlds and characters are confusing to young children. (The new book &#8220;Cinderella Ate My Daughter&#8221; by Peggy Orenstein discusses this issue particularly in relation to the &#8216;girlie&#8217; princess culture currently so popular.) No matter how convincingly they may assert that they know it’s make believe, children can’t help but be confused by stories that depict unrealistic and frightening characters and events. Preschoolers are figuring out the realities of things like their own body intactness and integrity, loving wishes and aggressive impulses, growing awareness of death and dying, what it means to grow up and how to remain secure in one’s family and still become a big person.</p>
<p>Stories about people who can fly, dying/sleeping and coming back to life/awakening, the scarecrow and tinman who are life-like but are missing a brain and a heart, the witch who melts, people who have the power to hurt or destroy others by an evil curse or a flick of the wand, the animals who plan to leave their overly-rambunctious friend alone in the dark woods to cure him of his bounciness &#8212; these all have so much potential for feeding confusion about the power of both thoughts and actions. Most importantly, such movies and stories gives children unrealistic material and characters to “try on” when what they really need to be doing is becoming themselves, becoming grounded in their own feelings: excited, happy, disappointed, loving, angry, jealous, curious. Children cannot fly, they do have a brain and a heart, they cannot melt, and sleeping is not dying.</p>
<p>There is plenty of time for children to become acquainted with the rich body of fairy tales and folk tales, fantasy and science fiction, and there are so many other pastimes that are more manageable for preschoolers. But sometimes parents need time for themselves – to cook dinner, to regain calm, to make an important phone call that can’t wait. Videos, when chosen with a child’s developmental level in mind, can be welcome aids for a maximum of 30 minutes at such times. For instance, Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood is suitable for most children over three. What makes these appropriate is their realistic setting, the gentle pacing, helpful and understandable lyrics, the clear delineation between the world of people and the “land of make-believe,” and the ever-present attention to feelings. Anything else that meets those criteria may make an occasional half-hour of watching a constructive and enjoyable experience for a preschooler.</p>
<p>Sometimes families fall into a habit of children watching TV or videos and then parents worry about what will happen if they decide to alter the pattern. Kids can seem almost addicted to their shows and videos. (Watch for a post soon about what it means when kids insist on watching the same show over and over.) In the past when we have seen families deal with the rough period of removing the scary movies or books from the home, we have always seen a positive change in the child’s ability to focus on his/her own interests in the classroom, and in the child’s efforts to connect with others in ways that the others can understand and welcome. In helping children with the adjustment, parents can say, “I know you like X story and so do I, but I’ve been thinking about it and I realize that it is really meant for older children.  We can read/look at it again when you are a little older. Dad and I made a mistake and we think it is better to read some different stories.”  If children ask why, parents can say that they are the parents, whose job is to keep children’s bodies, minds and feelings safe and that they don’t think that these stories are helping them feel safe right now: “Those stories are too scary for X-year-old boys  and girls. Sometimes they make children have feelings that are too big.” Limits like these are comforting to little ones, even if they put up a fight.</p>
<p>This brings us to our last category – the pleasure we grownups derive from fantasy material, whether it is novels, historical dramas, thrillers, films, opera, theater, science fiction and so forth. We want to introduce our children to this pleasure because we want to share with them all that is important to us. If we do this too soon, we may overwhelm our children and leave them vulnerable to anxiety that they can only assuage by clinging to us. If, on the other hand, we share the scope of imagination when children are secure in themselves and their own abilities and in the predictability of the world and people around them, then fantasy can expand horizons, stretch ideas of what is possible, and foster empathy and understanding.</p>

				<p><em>Dear Kerry,<br />
My kids’ teachers say that I should be supporting what they do at school by extending it at home. I’m not sure what they mean. Isn’t it their job to teach my kids? Sometimes I can’t answer the questions the children ask.<br />
RB, Georgia</em></p>
<p>Dear RB,<br />
One of the hardest things about becoming a parent is the feeling that you are suddenly expected to know all kinds of things no one ever taught you. But one of the nicest parts about being a parent can be the gradual discovery of all the resources you actually have inside. You know a lot more than you’ve realized and you’re teaching more than you thought. We can figure out how to tap into your knowledge and skills to offer your children an even richer learning environment in every part of their day.</p>
<p>Children look to us as grownups to keep them safe and make sense of their world. Keeping them safe is a big job, but most of us can look around, imagine possible dangers and do what’s needed to protect kids. Making sense of their experience is a bigger challenge, since we have to put ourselves in their shoes and imagine what’s important to them and what they are ready to understand.</p>
<p>Luckily, our kids point the way to what they need from us. Think about taking a walk with your toddler. His eyes were looking everywhere and he was pointing at everything. As soon as he could talk, the questions started. At that point, I’m sure you could answer all the questions – you could label a squirrel; you knew the color of the truck and how big the tree was. Every moment of the day is a teachable moment like that.</p>
<p>This is what your kids’ teachers are talking about. They know what an important role you have in expanding your children’s curiosity, sharing your interests and knowledge with them and, most of all, conveying the idea that you welcome their wish to know more. Your opinion is the most important to your kids. With your approval, they will get so much more from school and what their teachers have to offer. There are helpful websites for tips on practical ways to include these constructive moments in daily life for kids of different ages. One good one is <a href="http://teachmama.com">.</a></p>
<p>As they get older the questions get more complex and detailed; by the time they’re well into school, they are learning about stuff that may not even have been discovered when you were young! That’s the point at which you can teach them something far more important than the particular answer for the question.</p>
<p>You can set an example as a person who has the emotional muscle to admit you aren&#8217;t perfect. It isn’t embarrassing not to know something. Being a grownup or a good person doesn’t mean being a know-it-all – we all like to make friends with people who aren’t arrogant. What matters is the attitude of wanting to know, being curious and interested, and seeking how to find out.</p>
<p>You can give your children a crucial tool for life by engaging with them in finding out. “Let’s look that up,” “Let’s think who might know about that,” “Where do you think we could find that information?” You were their first teacher and now you can join with the folks at school as partners in your children’s growth.</p>

				<p><em>Dear Kerry,<br />
My grandmother died last year on my son’s 11th birthday. We were all very close to her. Now his birthday is coming up again. It feels awkward, but should I arrange his party anyway?<br />
MG, Massachusetts</em></p>
<p>Dear MG,<br />
I am sorry for your loss and the sadness for all in your family. Time helps the acuteness of the feelings, but you will always miss your grandmother and I am sure your son will too. Life inevitably brings many challenges to kids and grownups – what’s important is how you take those opportunities to learn, grow and strengthen your emotional muscles. Then you can help your child develop strengths that he can use throughout his life.</p>
<p>The muscle that comes from engaging with the challenge you describe is learning to tolerate mixed feelings. Very small children can’t manage to have more than one feeling at a time. Think of how toddlers get completely filled up with their excitement or their anger or their persistence! When they are mad, they forget that they also love you. It’s a big step to be able to hold on to love and anger at once. Parents can start helping even a 2-year-old master this step by reminding him that their love and his love are still there even when he’s mad.</p>
<p>As children grow, the combinations of feelings and wishes get more complex. 4-year-olds begin to think about time, change, and death and wonder how to put them together with the stability and happiness of daily life. This is where parents and teachers can help children learn about the life cycle, the satisfactions of a full life, and acceptance of those things that no one can control.</p>
<p>Your about-to-be-12-year-old can encompass deep ideas and practice holding more than one feeling at a time if you help him by setting an example. Ignoring either the sad feelings or the happy anticipation of his birthday would give him the message that one or the other feeling is not acceptable. The reality is that both feelings are there. Parents are the major interpreters of reality to children, even big kids in middle school! You can give him permission to feel happy about his birthday AND sad about his great-grandma, as well as letting him know that it’s all right to enjoy himself. It’s not an either/or, and one feeling doesn’t have to take away from the other.</p>
<p>I imagine that your grandmother loved seeing her grandchildren and great-grandchildren enjoying themselves. How lucky she was to have that chance and how lucky you all were to have her in your lives for so long! I think you can have a good time arranging your son’s party. You can mention to him how much your grandmother would have liked his pleasure with his family and friends. She would have been glad to see him growing up so nicely.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can make a special time the day before or on the morning of the anniversary/birthday to set out some flowers or light a candle or look especially at your grandmother’s picture with the whole family. Then you can remember her together, share your sad feelings at missing her and acknowledge their presence in the midst of life proceeding. This will build strengths your son can carry forward as life brings other losses and other joys.</p>

				<p><em>Dear Kerry,<br />
My son has had a chronic medical condition since he was a toddler. It never used to bother him, but now that he’s starting elementary school, he’s embarrassed about it. I’m worried about his self-esteem.<br />
MT, Pennsylvania</em></p>
<p>Dear MT,<br />
I am sorry to hear that your little boy is struggling with a situation that he can’t control. That’s hard on anyone. You don’t mention what his trouble is, and therefore what specific aspects may be worrying him, but there are some general considerations that apply to most people who are challenged by physical conditions that affect their daily lives. When something is always there, visible or not, it can have a big impact on how a child sees himself.</p>
<p>Parents are the definers of reality for their children. That means that our ideas and feelings have a big impact on our children’s attitudes. How they see themselves and the world is colored by what we know, think and feel. That is a heavy responsibility, but also a wonderful opportunity to shape your child’s experience. </p>
<p>It’s a blow as a parent to find out that your child has an illness or condition that may be with him life-long. If it threatens his functioning or his survival, that’s even scarier. Parents have a huge challenge in coming to terms with such news. Given how important our children are to us and how precious their safety and happiness, it takes lots and lots of work to process and integrate the situation. </p>
<p>Despite the unfortunate lack of general support and resources for parents in our society, there are many specific resources that have arisen to fill the gap in relation to particular needs. Often it is parents themselves, struggling with their fears and sadness for their children, who mobilize their strengths to develop important resources for others. Whatever your child’s condition, there is sure to be a website with information and support out there. A good initial step is to ask the physicians or nurses caring for your child for information and to seek it out yourself on the internet. </p>
<p>This is your first task – inform yourself about your child’s condition to the best of your understanding. He will have questions at each step in his development. If you are prepared to answer them with good factual information, your confidence and knowledge will convey to him that his situation does not have to be overwhelming. Instead you can impart the reality, sharing the load of the feelings and implications. </p>
<p>Once you have surmounted for yourself the hurdle of letting other people in your life know what is going on, you will be in a better position to tell your child how to think about other people’s feelings and reactions. Parents always worry about their child being singled out, teased, or even excluded because of his differences. The reality is that most other children are likely to be curious, friendly, and supportive, taking pleasure and pride in helping a friend. When other children have clear information that reassures them about their own worries when faced with an unfamiliar illness, like that it isn’t contagious, that your son didn’t do anything bad to make it happen, and so forth, they are most likely to be inclusive and helpful.</p>
<p>Your son needs your help and wisdom to trust that others will be understanding. Your part is to find out and allay his fears; inform his teachers about how they can explain his condition in ways his classmates can understand; make it all a matter-of-fact part of daily life; and be there for your son to master his feelings at each step along the way.</p>

				<p>Dear Readers,<br />
Jack and I had a wonderful experience last week in a Mexican town, where we were able to meet with some 30 parents of all ages. We talked about their lives, their children, their challenges and joys &#8211; it was exciting to discover that their questions reflected the same aspirations as parents we have met elsewhere. Parents of toddlers were grappling with &#8220;me do it&#8221; and how that can disrupt the best-laid plans; parents of school children were striving for balance in their lives; and parents of teens were thinking hard about helping their children make good judgments in a complex world.<br />
Everyone found the ideas from EMOTIONAL MUSCLE: STRONG PARENTS, STRONG CHILDREN very helpful and we learned a lot to include in the next edition.<br />
Plus we all had coffee and delicious pastries provided by the organizer, one of the owners of Tiramisu Restaurant!</p>

				<p><em>Dear Kerry,<br />
My son is 7 and he complains a lot about being &#8220;bored.&#8221; He acts as if he expects us to entertain him all the time. Obviously, this isn&#8217;t going to happen and it’s also pretty annoying. I&#8217;m getting tired and frustrated with his whining. What can I do?<br />
NR, Indiana</em></p>
<p>Dear NR,<br />
You’re not alone! Many readers have shared similar experiences of frustration and puzzlement. Their nice kids get irritating and demanding with the “boredom” they are expressing. Nice parents, who already are devoted to their children, can start to feel defensive and even just want to get away from the constant whining. These are good signals of a slide you can reverse.</p>
<p>There are two important sets of relationships children develop as they grow. One is with other people. The other is with themselves. But relationships mean engagement and interaction. When someone says they are bored, they have disconnected from the people and activities around them. Even worse, they may have disconnected from themselves.</p>
<p>So one question to consider is whether your child is retreating from something upsetting or difficult. 7-year-olds are starting a long path of social involvement at school. That isn’t always easy, since cliques may already be forming. Children his age have developed a good capacity for making comparisons, but that can be a mixed blessing. Schoolkids may compare themselves or their families unfavorably to others and feel uncertain or worse. It’s worth doing some gentle probing to check in on how things are going with other kids, or what it felt like to go over to his friend’s house and see how they do things there. Demanding that you entertain him may be a coded way to ask for your help or support around social issues and self-esteem. </p>
<p>It’s more likely, however, that a busy family can fall into some habits that promote the ‘boredom response.’ With family time rarer and more precious than ever, parents often try too hard to devise activities the kids will like. It will backfire, however, if the only things you do are especially for children. It’s just as important to introduce them to the activities you enjoy and value. Finding a way to share your enthusiasms, for instance, making a visit to a museum show you are interested in accessible to your youngster, or taking him bird-watching, will give him a valuable incentive to grow up and expand his interests.</p>
<p>You can think of this as a challenge for you and your child. Unlike food, where children should be allowed to make free choices among the nutritious offerings, you are in charge of activities and outings, while welcoming suggestions from your child. Whatever the plan, grownups and children alike are challenged to make it interesting for themselves. I don’t accept the boredom excuse – rather I translate that into a signal that the person isn’t doing enough to find something to learn, enjoy, or consider in the experience. I would say, “I’m sorry you’re bored. But it’s not my job to fix that. You’re the one who can find what is interesting in anything.”</p>
<p>Parents may need to practice developing the emotional muscle of active engagement. When someone at work talks at length about their weekend and you are tempted to slide toward boredom, think instead “What can I learn about this person from his enthusiasm for fly-fishing? Maybe if I ask him what the specific pleasures are for him, it will broaden my understanding.” As you strengthen your capacity for curiosity, interest and involvement, you will feel more comfortable expecting the same from your child, and teaching him ways to grow on this dimension. He will have to work at the new skill, gradually building up his own emotional muscles for finding pleasure in a bigger proportion of his experience.</p>
<p>We all know people who just seem to have zest for life and more energy than others. I think they are the ones who have tapped into their curiosity and enjoyment of their inner and outer worlds – they are almost never bored. </p>

				<p><em>Dear Kerry,<br />
We have a regular conference coming up with my daughter’s 2nd grade teacher. She seems like a nice person, but I have questions about some of her methods. I don’t want to antagonize her, since I don’t want my child to suffer. I always get nervous before these meetings. Any tips?<br />
LR, Plymouth</em></p>
<p>Dear LR,<br />
Parent-teacher conferences are designed to help parents and teachers work together as a team. But, all too often, they get loaded with other feelings that can undermine a positive process. Did you know that teachers get terribly nervous before conferences too? It seems as if both sides could use some insight to change the atmosphere. If we step back from the immediate for a minute, we can see some of the roots of the trouble.</p>
<p>We all relate to people on the base of earlier experience. Everyone knows that children who have loving, secure early relationships are most likely to grow up to be trusting, optimistic adults. Those big dimensions are pretty obvious. But it’s also true that there are other parts of our old relationships that persist into adulthood.</p>
<p>Think about how you felt about your first- or second-grade teacher. Wasn’t he or she the most knowledgeable, nicest person you had ever met? What your teacher said became gospel, for at least the first few years of school. If your teacher disapproved or scolded, it was powerful and made you feel bad. We all carry residues of that intense respect and reliance on teachers as authorities. We think of teachers with a capital “T.” </p>
<p>Teachers have the same sorts of feelings about parents – after all, everyone has had parents and has looked up to them as the ultimate authority and judge through the early years. Teachers often unconsciously think of parents with a capital “P.” </p>
<p>So both parents and teachers can walk into conferences worrying that each is going to judge the other. Teachers fear being blamed and parents think they will be criticized. This is a recipe for a wasted meeting and bad feelings afterwards. What can you do to make the conference a constructive part of the partnership you want with your child’s school to support her development?</p>
<p>There may be real issues that both parents and teachers want to address. Parents often feel concerns about what they hear from their kids about the classroom. At the same time, they want to approve of and support the teacher. Teachers often wish that parents sent them children who are better-behaved, kind, attentive, and know how to control their impulses and feelings. </p>
<p>How can you approach tough topics without hurting feelings or antagonizing someone important in your child’s life? The pre-conference work is to set yourself to SHARE information and concerns. You can bring information and perceptions from home that will help your daughter’s teacher know her better and appreciate where she is coming from.</p>
<p>Then you can think through what your QUESTIONS are – sincere curiosity about why the teacher approaches a topic the way she does, or how to help your child get the most from an assignment, gives the teacher a chance to use her professional knowledge to help you understand the lessons and rules of the classroom. </p>
<p>Don’t leave the conference without an agreement with the teacher about NEXT STEPS. When you have devised goals for moving forward together, you will truly be working as a team for your daughter’s growth on all fronts. Parents and teachers can feel supported by shared expectations and plans to implement them, to your child’s ultimate benefit.</p>

				<p><em>Dear Kerry,<br />
What advice or comment do you have for a first time stay-at-home Mom with a 10-month-old baby? It feels at the same time both incredibly interesting and terribly boring. Sometimes I feel very blessed to have a baby and am totally engaged in being with him and seeing/helping him develop new skills. Other times, and these are the ones that I worry might be damaging to him, I feel resentful at being disturbed from my adult tasks and may have an angry/frustrated look on my face while attending to him. I know he can sense this because he is more difficult to comfort or dress, etc. at those times. I would like to increase the amount of time I can stay really engaged with him, as when this happens it is a real joy and one of the best things in life &#8212; we have a lot of fun and laughing then.<br />
GM, Ohio</em></p>
<p>Dear GM,<br />
How lucky for you and your baby that you are able to be with each other and are enjoying so much of your time together! The good moments are indeed a “real joy.” Thank you for your honesty about the conflict between your pleasure and wish to do well by your baby, and your adult needs. It shows you have the emotional muscle to face the reality of your feelings inside. The dilemma that you describe so vividly is probably shared by all moms and dads and caregivers who spend long days with infants and toddlers, and I think that everyone in that situation worries about whether there is something wrong with having mixed feelings. However fascinating the little ones’ development is, it is hard to be alone, without adult conversation, stimulation and input for hours at a time.</p>
<p>First let’s go to the science of it all. There has been an explosion of research over the past 30 or 40 years about infant development and the role of interaction between babies and parents. From the early discussions of attachment and attunement to our more recent understanding of how soon babies can be active players in their experience, and how sophisticated they are, we now know a lot more than we used to. </p>
<p>One of the side-effects of all this research, and the way it has been translated in the media, is that parents can’t deny how important they are to their children’s development. That is wonderful, but it can also become a burden. If you are so responsible, what if you do it wrong? If you aren’t totally in tune with your baby 24/7, will this harm her development? Will she grow up unable to relate to others, or unable to control her behavior, or not do well at school? Will she have friends and be a nice person? No wonder you worry that your angry face will harm your little one, or that your distraction at times will spoil his early experience.</p>
<p>But the research also offers us a truly important and reassuring finding. Even in the best-functioning parent-child pairs, where development is proceeding optimally and everything seems just fine, parents and their babies are attuned about 30% of the time. Think about that – our attention and stimulation and emotional connection are so rich for babies that even 1/3 of it fuels them more than adequately. So you don’t have to feel guilty that you aren’t always totally zeroed in. Being a “good-enough” parent is good enough.</p>
<p>What the research also shows is that the really important thing is how we move back from a distracted or negative feeling state with our babies to a positive connection. The reconnection is what matters.  Our method of getting back in touch is what teaches babies how to deal with feelings and reach out to others.</p>
<p>Clearly we want to maximize our togetherness, whether we are able to be with our babies full-time or part-time. We also want to ensure that, if others are caring for them, they too are paying attention to our children as well as they can. There are lots of ways to meet your baby’s needs and also your own.</p>
<p>10-month-olds are very, very busy learners, with their bodies and their minds. They usually have several words in their vocabularies and lots of sounds that mean something to them. They are actively crawling, often cruising, and some of them are already walking. They are busy exploring particularly the relationships between the objects and people in their world.</p>
<p>This is the time when they want to be able to make something happen with their toys. Containers are often the most fascinating playthings. You can supply literally hours of play with Tupperware and wooden spoons, small blocks that fit inside, stacking and nesting cups, a wine bottle carton with paper towel rolls to fit in the inserts – your baby will take them in and out and move them around for a long time! Small wooden cars that can be pushed, or walking toys to lean on and trundle around the house, give these older babies a sense of agency that satisfies their growing need to feel in charge of themselves.</p>
<p>And what about your needs? It will enhance and enlarge your baby’s experience if you play music that you like while you spend time together. Introduce your baby to bluegrass, r &#038;b, string quartets, fado, sitar music – you will feed your soul, your baby will feel your pleasure, and her brain will lay down expanded tracks for sounds and rhythms. Now that she is 10 months old, she can keep you company while you do the laundry, cook the supper, weed the garden. </p>
<p>Most public libraries have story times for little ones. Be sure you get out to spend time with other parents and children. If there isn’t a playgroup or parent-toddler program at a local preschool or community center, you can start a Round Robin group with three of four other parents with children the same age. If you meet once a week in each other’s houses in turn, your children will have social experience and you will too. Plus you will develop a group of trusted friends for support, as well as people your child knows, so you can trade babysitting or rely on each other in case of emergency need.</p>
<p>These are precious months – enjoy the good parts and relax in the knowledge that you are already offering your child the very greatest gift &#8212; time with you.</p>

<em>Dear Kerry,</em></p>
<p><em>My 11-year-old son is often bullied by another boy at school. His teachers always sit them down and get them to talk through the incident. But nothing changes. The other kid continues to harass my boy and I’m not sure how to help him stand up for himself.</em></p>
<p><em>ET, Farmington</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Dear ET,</p>
<p>It is always painful to see your child being victimized and frustrating to feel that he can’t keep himself safe. Both kids will be harmed by these aggressive interactions, so you’re right to be concerned and want to make a change. Although schools usually now have anti-bullying policies, they aren’t always effective and teachers often don’t get ongoing support to implement them fully.</p>
<p>It’s best for children and for the community if parents and teachers can work as a team. Your boy needs you to advocate for him by joining his teachers in making their interventions more effective. It’s a good first step in conflict resolution to have the boys sit down and talk through their dispute. Unfortunately, though, people tend to think that should change things, but it’s only the first step, and there are three more steps needed to make a lasting difference.</p>
<p>The next step is to work with your son to address his self-confidence. You may need to think about whether you have really given him the space to speak up, as well as appropriate limits and responsibilities to balance his wishes and reality. He needs your help to validate asserting himself, so that he feels that grownups will truly back him when he sticks up for himself. He will also need your help to develop the emotional muscle of scaling his feelings and reactions to the size of the problem. If his self-esteem has dipped too low, he may need professional help to add to what you can give him.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that he is contributing to the problem by provoking in some way. Often kids don’t realize that they have gotten into a pattern of involvement with a bully where they play a role in prolonging the bad interaction, for instance, like younger kids who let themselves be chased, rather than refusing point blank to start that game and seeking out an adult for help. Reconstructing the events in detail may raise your son’s awareness of any part he may be playing. It isn’t blaming him to consider that he may have some responsibility or choice points along the way in the chain of events.</p>
<p>His teachers may need your support to follow up on their first conflict-resolution step. Their next step is to make a plan with the boys for how they will behave differently and how they will monitor results. Your son may wish the other guy could be made to disappear, but the solutions have to be realistic and fair to both children. Kids and teachers will have to work together to track how well they are following the plan.</p>
<p>And, if they don’t follow the plan, there have to be further consequences. Each school decides what those should be, but parents can offer their ideas. Perhaps the boys will have to work together under a teacher’s supervision to help the third-graders in the playground, or read to the first-graders and help them write their book reports. Both boys can be appreciated for the strength and maturity they show in setting an example to the younger kids.</p>
<p>When children get self-esteem from authentic achievements and skills, they won’t need to feel good by putting someone else down or getting attention by being a victim. They might even discover that they admire some qualities in each other!</p>
