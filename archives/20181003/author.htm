<h3>GOOD GOODBYES: KNOWING HOW TO END IN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND PSYCHOANALYSIS</h3>
Published in 2006
<img src="images/goodbyes.jpg" align=right>
<div id="quote">Within the framework of the therapeutic relationship and a clearly articulated set of goals for therapy, Jack Novick and Kerry Kelly Novick described how to recognize and respond to termination themes from the very beginning of treatment. Each phase of treatment brings its own challenges, as well as the risk of premature ending by patient and therapist. 
With vivid clinical examples from all diagnostic groups and all stages of development, the Novicks demonstrate how to engage each patient in building the “emotional muscle” needed to master life’s challenges, transform early losses, and integrate new experiences of joy and sadness into the personality.
“Through vivid and compelling vignettes … they demonstrate that … a patient’s system of self-regulation can be transformed from one that is joyless, constricted and closed to one that is healthy, alive and open.” <br />
